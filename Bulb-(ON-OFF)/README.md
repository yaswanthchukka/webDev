# Bulb Control Webpage

This is a simple webpage that allows you to control a virtual bulb using two buttons: "ON" and "OFF". The bulb is represented by a box inside a circular shape. Clicking the "ON" button changes the color of the bulb to yellow, indicating that it's turned on. Clicking the "OFF" button changes the color back to gray, indicating that it's turned off.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click the "ON" button to turn the bulb on.
3. Click the "ONN" button to turn the bulb off.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic to control the bulb.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing styles for the webpage elements.
